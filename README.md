 Hello Word !! 

 I'm Kroma, just a new web developer, right now iÂ´m learning next.js but i know some of html, css, bootstrap, python, 
 javascript, sql, react, flask, and others. CHECK  OUT MY REPOSITORY !!!  I think my best project is kromawebapp, it was the 
 final project for an edx course, and it is very important because it was the first time that I feel proud of something that 
 I created as a programmer or developer and I think it shows another facet of me being.

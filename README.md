## Hello Word ðŸŒŽ!! 

 I'm an Arquitect (the real ones), Street Artist and Front-End Developer. I think my best project is kromawebapp, it was the 
 final project for an edx course, and it's very important for me because it was the first time that I feel proud of something that 
 i created as a web developer and I think it shows another facet of me being.
